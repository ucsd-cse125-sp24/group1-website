<li><p>what were your concrete goals for the week?</p>
<p>Establishing the foundations for the server game logic such as abstractions for entities and player inputs</p>
</li>
<li><p>what goals were you able to accomplish?</p>
<p>wrote an abstract design for base entity and other types of entities, let the cannon-es handle physics engine, partially designed a player input system, serialized the game object to send over to clients.</p>
</li>

<p>This week went pretty much the same way as I planned, which is very validating to me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>what are your specific goals for the next week?</p>
<p>Finish the player input system and work with Tyler on the Game logic</p>
</li>
<li><p>what did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</p>
<p>I learned how typescript syntax can allow some crazy abstraction for scalable code base. In addition, I learned about cannon-es as a physics engine typescript package and some basics over how to use it. I did expect to learn both.</p>
</li>
<li><p>what is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</p>
<p>Much much better than last week. I feel way better talking to everyone the group and I’m glad we figured out a system to make sure everyone is on track, which is writing updates to the corresponding channel in the discord.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tyler">Tyler</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>what were your concrete goals for the week?</p>
<p>My concrete goals for the week were to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Meet with Nick and the Networking team about the restructuring we talked about in the weekly meeting</li>
<li>Create the capsule collider and successfully lock it&#8217;s y axis with Nick</li>
<li>Create the Entity interface, and possibly create a few Entity implementations that we can test with and work on</li>
<li>Talk with Marcello</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>what goals were you able to accomplish?</p>
<p>I think I got them all actually!</p>
<p>I successfully talked with marcelo, helped the group with a little bit of a communication issue, and learned quite a bit about typescript and our current codebase.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the group expert on the server side data, not at all, but I absolutely know my way around, and I&#8217;ve lost quite a bit of the imposter syndrome that I was worried about.</p>
<p>I met with Nick and created the Capsule Collider for the player that we were interested in, and fully created the Entity interface with some implementations (more to come)</p>
<p>The only thing that we didn&#8217;t get done was locking the y axis for the capsule collider, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that it won&#8217;t be too bad.</p>
</li>
<li><p>if the week went differently than you had planned, what were the
reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to
be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit
yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. so answering
this question is more of a reflection on the development process
and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</p>
<p>mmmm, there was a few things that I would have perferred to be able to get done that weren&#8217;t directly on my list.</p>
<p>After talking with Nick, I wanted to give myself a networking challenge, which would be to work on the game enough that we could have multiple players working on it instead of just one.
However, I didn&#8217;t actually get to work on it because of some mental health stuff, which is an acceptable loss, in my mind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m much more famailiar with networking and the codebase than I thought I would be at the beginning of the week though, which is a huge plus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>what are your specific goals for the next week?</p>
<ol>
<li>Work on the branch to get multiple players on the network (not cookies)</li>
<li>Work with Nick to get some really basic cookies working for the game</li>
<li>Do some significant work on the actual game logic. SPECIFICALLY, I want to create an interactible entity</li>
<li>Create some new Entity implementations so that we can be a bit more specific when working with stuff</li>
<li>Talk with Killian about getting someone else also on Blender</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>what did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</p>
<p>I learned a huge amount about how our current codebase and networking works in general, enough that I was able to have several fairly competent discussions with other very competent people about how the current system works, and I was correctly understanding the system, which is great!</p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea that I would be learning so much so fast, and I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be this proficient* by this point either. I figured I would still be super far behind by now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>what is your individual morale (which might be different from the
overall group morale)?</p>
<p>My morale is actually pretty okay for right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit about the system, and I feel comfortable enough with it that I think I could add something small without it all breaking horrendously.</p>
<p>A lot of my other side stuff is calming down as well, so I might actually have time to work on some of the backlog of personal stuff that I need to get done, which has definitely been weighing on me.</p>
<p>All this is good! Basically what I&#8217;m saying is that things are starting to look up. :)</p>

<p>My goal for the past week was to clean up the codebase. Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t really happened yet. This is partly because I don&#8217;t really know where the project will go graphics-wise (for example, are we going to exclusively use Blender models, or might we have models with special code, like animating a plane&#8217;s vertices to have water ripples? will we have a bloom shader post-processing step? etc.) And I am still learning about the quirks of WebGL and developing a conceptual model of it. I&#8217;m not sure if we should just keep going with spaghetti code until we understand what exactly we&#8217;re doing, or if we should decide now how we want to represent 3D objects in our code.</p>
<p>I also made smaller additions and fixes in the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our GitHub Pages preview now spins up our server in a Web Worker. Because our server was written in JS, we can run it directly in the browser.</li>
<li>Fixed our fish model not rendering on Macs.</li>
<li>Added wireframe spheres.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past week flew by faster than expected, and I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe it&#8217;s just because week 2 included some development progress from week 1, so I expected more progress this week.</p>
<p>Also, I thought more about how I want to refactor our graphics code. I think I will want to keep everything relatively low-level and only have helper functions wrapping WebGL calls. I think if we try to abstract away implementation details too much, we&#8217;ll end up changing it frequently as we tune the visuals.</p>
<p>Graphics is currently still waiting on the networking team, so there isn&#8217;t really much to do. I could potentially work on adding a bloom effect though.</p>
<p>I would say my current morale is a bit less motivated than last week, but still pretty motivated overall.</p>
<h3 id="will">Will</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>My goals for the past week were to implement point lighting and camera panning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I implemented camera panning using the mouse and Sean extended it to work on touchscreen devices. I also made an initial point light implementation, but there are some limitations imposed by WebGL (like a small number of lights per draw) and some unresolved questions that depend on other decisions we need to make (like where to store the light objects). For the limitations, whether/how we need to find workarounds will also depend on some game design decisions, like whether we want a darker ambiance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I would have liked to do more testing on the lighting implementation so we can see how many objects and lights it can handle before performance starts suffering. It took a while to iron out all the texture map and shader bugs so I didn’t get to do that as of writing this. I think it’ll end up being easier to do some stress testing anyway after we have a more well-defined client-server interaction, so I can just directly test on real entities instead of fake/temporary ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Goals for next week include testing the lighting more (make sure shadows look correct and find performance limits), solidifying our shader pipeline (e.g. figuring out how to incorporate the cel shader as a postprocessing step) with the rest of the graphics team, making some placeholder Blender models if needed, and helping Kenzo with a particle system if needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I learned that WebGL has some stricter limitations than OpenGL, e.g. on the allowed combinations of framebuffer attachments or how we have to make 6 separate draw calls to render a cubic depth map for various reasons. This is a little bit of a pain because it means that some tutorials designed for OpenGL don’t work in WebGL, and it’s not always obvious that the reason is because WebGL doesn’t let you do a particular thing that OpenGL allows. But no one said graphics is easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think we’re still making good progress, although it’s taken longer to get client inputs onto the server than maybe we were hoping. But we have a solid graphics foundation shaping up.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="meeting-notes">Meeting notes</h2>
<p>Present: Sean, Marcelo, Will, Kenzo, Tyler</p>
<p>Excused: Killian</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyler: rn we are only sending are colliders. but only character model is being displayed. so how does client know what colliders belong to what model<ul>
<li>game state is essentially list of entities</li>
<li>marcelo: serialize game info, like phase of the game?<ul>
<li>tyler: first part of game packet could be game metadata, followed by entities. game data is later problem</li>
<li>task for Sean: read model string, display model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(networking) Update: modified the serialization system so that it correctly serialize from the game object, mild restructurization over the entities to include their own serialzation methods</li>
<li>Tyler: we will probably have to restructure the team because we are reaching a point where graphics and network are setup</li>
</ul>

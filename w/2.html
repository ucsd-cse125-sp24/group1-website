      A: a classic abandoned fort/castle aesthetic, pretty generic but it does fit the silly party game aesthetic were going for the best bc its an aesthetic everyone knows well and are comfortable seeing
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../images/concept/map-idea-b.png" alt="ALT">
    <figcaption>
      B: a more dark and spooky underground dungeon vibe, this leans more towards the horror aspect since all the walls and floors are dark, making even lit up rooms still seem dark and eerie
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../images/concept/map-idea-c.png" alt="ALT">
    <figcaption>
      C: also another abandoned fort/castle/temple aesthetic, this time with more nature elements infesting the place, this would make room to make the boss more plant/earth themed but also makes the game seems more serious? (in my opinion at least since the whole human vs. environment thing could be read into many diff ways)
    </figcaption>

    <img src="../images/concept/map-idea-d.png" alt="ALT">
    <figcaption>
      D: a more high fantasy theme, with bright colorful walls and decorations, could might look too magical for a game thats about crafting more mundane tools, but maybe it would be cool?
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../images/concept/mushroom-king.png" alt="ALT">
    <figcaption>
      the boss could be some sort of mushroom king and the little minion is a tiny little mushroom minion who managed through slip through the cracks of the rock barrier and messes w the players as the mushroom king is breaking down the barrier

      the camera is moving on the client side, and all the boxes are being moved on the server side. the server only moves everything at 25 fps which is why it looks choppy

      okay networking team, it draws your colliders now. there&#8217;s also support for flat squares if you want to add floors and stuff

<li>what were your concrete goals for the week?</li>
<li>what goals were you able to accomplish?</li>
<li>if the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly&#8230;I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</li>
<li>what are your specific goals for the next week?</li>
<li>what did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</li>
<li>what is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</li>

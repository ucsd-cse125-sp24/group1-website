<p>Meeting: <a href="#meeting-notes">Sunday, May 26, 2024</a></p>

<ol>
<li>what were your concrete goals for the week?</li>
<li>what goals were you able to accomplish?</li>
<li>if the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly&#8230;I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know youâ€™ll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, itâ€™s not at all an evaluation.</li>
<li>what are your specific goals for the next week?</li>
<li>what did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</li>
<li>what is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</li>

<h2 id="meeting-notes">Meeting notes</h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s meeting was moved online because four of us are sick.</p>
<p>Present: Sean, Tyler, Will, Kenzo, Killian</p>
<ul>
<li>it&#8217;s week 9. two weeks left. no playable demo yet. probably no combat<ul>
<li>sean: currently there&#8217;s punching, but that&#8217;s probably more sabotage than combat</li>
<li>for combat, we&#8217;d need inventory, potions, armor, bows, which can&#8217;t rotate in your hand</li>
<li>need big boss model, crafting table models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we need: win condition, new map and that&#8217;s it<ul>
<li>and playtest<ul>
<li>hard to select items</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>models a little scuffed<ul>
<li>need to give each item a different collider</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rn there are sound effects,<ul>
<li>marcelo said he wanted to. not sure where he&#8217;s been<ul>
<li>he&#8217;s playing minecraft</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>game is a bit laggy<ul>
<li>probably with many items/meshes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>playtesting<ul>
<li>sound effects are funny</li>
<li>we have spawner now, but it&#8217;s buggy (need to throw axe at it but it currently works without it)<ul>
<li>player collisions also spawn item</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hit reach distance is very far</li>
<li>lag is an issue</li>
<li>kenzo&#8217;s PC has same issue as Nick&#8217;s, with weird buggy rendering</li>
<li>reticle not being rendered</li>
<li>crafters work, spawners work</li>
<li>standing on players/crafters makes you really slow, and can&#8217;t jump on players</li>
<li>need timer</li>
<li>options menu, an actual UI<ul>
<li>mouse sensitivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>killian: do we need big/little boss<ul>
<li>not as important. just need crafting models (furnace and crafting table and potion station)<ul>
<li>forest for wood</li>
<li>ore vein for ore</li>
<li>spiderwebs for string</li>
<li>mushrooms</li>
<li>crafting stations: anvil for making knife, sword, armor, ingot. bow and magic sauce at their own tables. furnace to combine wood + ore for ingot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>killian: map idea for two levels:<ul>
<li>top level is abandoned living area: crafters and wood source (forest/broken furniture)</li>
<li>lower level is darker, abandoned work area: mushrooms, iron, spiderweb</li>
<li>tyler: have holes from top to bottom, can throw items down and accidentally fall. and prevents people from clashing with e/o on the stairs</li>
<li>tyler: need to double size of the map<ul>
<li>killian: will make upper level larger</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tyler: need menu/UI for showing tutorial page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divy up work instead of making it free-for-all<ul>
<li>sean: performance</li>
<li>will: win condition, fix crosshair</li>
<li>kenzo: still trying to work on blind sabotage, unsure how to move camera<ul>
<li>will already did that. boss can spore player to reduce vision</li>
<li>tyler: just keep what you&#8217;re doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we need particles<ul>
<li>can implement it like sound. server plays particles at position, <code>this.game.playParticle</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>combat could be free for all since it&#8217;s not MVP<ul>
<li>will could do it soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tyler: fix spawner, populate crafters. after that, implement combat, like sword or bow shoot arrows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tyler: doesn&#8217;t seem like people are passionate about this anymore. it&#8217;s week 9. some people have been absent<ul>
<li>will: people are sick</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>marcelo and nick not here. cringe</li>
<li>can playtest on tuesday. game is at playtestable state</li>
<li>will tried to fix reticle but still doesn&#8217;t work. sean might work on it since will can&#8217;t reproduce it</li>
<li>killian will be back in SD tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary of to-do items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafter models (Killian)</li>

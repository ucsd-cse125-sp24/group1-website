<li>what were your concrete goals for the week?</li>
<li>what goals were you able to accomplish?</li>
<li>if the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly&#8230;I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know youâ€™ll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, itâ€™s not at all an evaluation.</li>
<li>what are your specific goals for the next week?</li>
<li>what did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</li>
<li>what is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</li>
